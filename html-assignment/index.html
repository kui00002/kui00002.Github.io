      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <em>Hanyu Kui</em>. This is my 5<sup>th</sup> year I have been here in Ottawa. And I am originally from Beijing, the capital of China. I received my master's degree in <b>System Science</b> from the University of Ottawa in 2018. During that period, I studied Java programming and Information Management as my main field. <br>
        In my leisure time, I enjoy graphic designing and photography. I think that will be the main reason I join the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> Program. This Program seems like a great opportunity to advance and combine those skills I just talked about. And I am ready to continue building my career and challenging myself in the future.
