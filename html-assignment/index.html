      <p>
        My name is <b>Hanyu Kui</b> and my English name is <b>Kay</b>. This is the 5<sup>th</sup> year I have been here in Ottawa. I am originally from <b>Beijing</b>, the capital of <b>CHINA</b>. I am 28 years old and I am the only child in my family. I received my master&apos;s degree in <em>System Science</em> from the <em>University of Ottawa</em> in 2018. Since that time, I have started learning Java programming and management of information systems.

      <!---------- paragraph 2 ---------->
      <p>
        In my leisure time, I enjoy playing the piano, drawing, graphic designing and taking photographs. I&apos;ve always been passionate about Art. I think this is also the main reason I join the <b><abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr></b> Program. This Program seems like a great opportunity to advance and combine those skills I just talk about. And I am ready to continue building my career and challenging myself in the future.
