      <!---------- paragraph 1 ---------->
      <p>
        My name is <b>Hanyu Kui</b>. This is the 5<sup>th</sup> year I have been here in Ottawa, Canada. And I am originally from Beijing, the capital of China. I received my master&apos;s degree in <em>System Science</em> from the <em>University of Ottawa</em> in 2018. Since that period, I start learning Java programming and information system management. 
      </p>
      <!---------- paragraph 2 ---------->
      <p>
        In my leisure time, I enjoy graphic designing and photography. I think that will be the main reason I join the <b><abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr></b> Program. This Program seems like a great opportunity to advance and combine those skills. And I am ready to continue building my career and challenging myself in the future.
